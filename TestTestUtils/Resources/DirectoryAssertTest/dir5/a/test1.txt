A hefty 83% of such sentences were mandatory. That is, a state or federal law barred the judge from exercising any discretion (or indeed, common sense). 
Some were triggered by “three-strikes” laws, which demand a severe penalty for a third crime, no matter how minor, if the defendant was previously convicted of two others. 
XXmetimes, those previous convictions can be from the far past. Sylvester Mead, for instance, earned life without parole for slurring drunken threats 
at a policeman while handcuffed in the back of a patrol car; he had convictions for battery and burglary six and 16 years previously. Mr Mead’s last crime, 
public intimidation, usually carries a sentence of no more than five years. The judge said it “does not warrant, under any conscionable or constitutional basis,
 a life sentence”, but explained: “I have no choice.”
